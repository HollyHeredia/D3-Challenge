# D3-Challenge
Making a fancy graph for D3 homework.

In this challenge, I used D3.js to make a graph detailing 3 X and 3 Y axis, included state abbreviations in my dots, and a tool tip to gather more information upon mouseover of each data point. The started code included an HTML framework. 

The data has to do with state-level data regarding population and health based info from the 2014 U.S. Census data. The HTML simulates an on-line news paper detailing the data.

# File Structure:
+ Most files can be found in Code/D3_data_journalism
+ index.html for the HTML code.
+ Folder: assets
  + CSS for css code for the webpage
  + Data contains the csv file which the graph is build around.
  + JS contains the app.js code containing the bulk of the work for this assignment.

# Running
Due to loading in a csv file, many browsers will fil to load this unless running on an http server. This project was developed by running python -m http.server in the command line.

Enjoy!
